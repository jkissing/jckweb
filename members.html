                            <p class="member-bio">Dr. Jessica "Jessie" Kissinger is a professor of Genetics and former director of the Institute of Bioinformatics (2010-2019). Her research focuses on the evolution of protist parasite genomes (nuclear, plastid and mitochondrial), in particular, the genomes of organisms that cause malaria, toxoplasmosis and cryptosporidiosis. Her research area has necessitated the development of new computational tools to address issues of gene transfer and syntenic regions of genome sequences as well tools related to data integration, data sharing and data mining. She also maintains a traditional "wet laboratory" for validation of experimental findings. One of the resources that she helped to develop, and for which she is now a Co-I, is VEuPathDB. This database, which has evolved into a large international project, serves the eukaryotic pathogen and vector research community. Her research has led her to be involved in numerous international collaborations. She lived in Brazil for two years while studying malaria and she returned for 20 years as joint-PI of a Fogarty Bioinformatics training grants and as a researcher in the Ciências sem Fronteiras program. She also spent time in Uganda as a Fulbright Scholar working at the African Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Data Science.</p>
